# Micrograd in Zig

Inspired by [Micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) and [Zigrograd](https://github.com/nurpax/zigrograd) (you will notice some similarities).

Its only purpose is to serve as a toy example to follow along with Andrej Karpathy's videos.

## Example

_None yet._

## How to run

There's nothing to run yet, but the micrograd engine works, so:

`zig build run`

should output the results of an example neuron in JSON.
